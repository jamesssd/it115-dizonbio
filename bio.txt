Hello, my name is James Dizon, I am a up and coming Software Developer. In the beginning of 2019, I took a risk and chose to transition from Pre-Nursing to a Full Stack Web Developer. With my first child on the way, I realized I wanted to set an example for him and pursue a path I’ve always dreamt about, but didn’t have a courage to follow. Since I was young, technology has always been a way for me to escape from my daily stress in life. It gave me a sense of excitement knowing that I can learn so much in this field.

Through the University of Washington, I enrolled and completed an intensive 12-week coding boot camp. The experience was demanding, yet rewarding as I built a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Node,js, React, React Native, RESTful APIs, MySQL, NoSQL, Express, Handlebars, MongoDB, Git, and Product Management. Not only did I become equipped with the technical skills to become a developer, I also grew more proficient in communicating, leading, and problem solving.

With the end of the program, I hope to work in a company that allows me as a developer to polish and supplement the skills I have learned from this program. And hopefully I get the chance to use the skills I have acquired and help future developers to gain momentum and give them the advice and confidence they need to be successful in this field.
